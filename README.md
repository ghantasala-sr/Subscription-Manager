Subscription Manager
--------------------------
In today's service-oriented economy, individuals often subscribe to multiple services, including streaming
platforms, utility providers, and software memberships. Managing these subscriptions effectively presents
a significant challenge. Many users lose track of renewal dates, inadvertently incurring unexpected
charges and continuing to pay for services they no longer need, leading to unnecessary expenses.
The absence of a dedicated, centralized system to monitor, analyze, and optimize these recurring
payments results in widespread financial inefficiencies and a lack of control over personal finances.

The developed Subscription Manager iOS app offers a robust solution by enabling users to efficiently
track all their recurring payments in one place. It provides timely renewal reminders to prevent unwanted
charges and offers valuable insights into subscription spending patterns.
The core of the app is a centralized dashboard displaying all active subscriptions, allowing users to
categorize them and calculate both monthly and yearly expenditures. To further enhance user experience
and financial control, the app incorporates advanced features such as customizable billing cycles and
AI-powered suggestions for cost optimization.
Customizable notifications give users precise control over when they receive payment reminders.
Ultimately, the app aims to empower users to make well-informed financial decisions regarding their
subscriptions.

The application leverages modern technologies to deliver a seamless user experience on iOS:
* User Interface: Built natively using Swift UI for a modern and responsive interface.
* Database & Authentication: Utilizes Firebase for secure cloud-based data storage and user
authentication.
* Machine Learning: Integrates CoreML, Apple's framework, to provide intelligent spending
analysis and insights.
* Deployment Target: Compatible with iOS 16 and newer versions.
